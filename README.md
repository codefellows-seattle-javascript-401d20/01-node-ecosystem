## Greet
  Greet contains a function that accepts the user's name(for example, Brandon) as its only airity and returns the greeting "hello Brandon".  The function will return "null" if the airity is empty or a number.

## Arithmetic
  Arithmetic has 2 functions that individually adds and subtracts 2 airities.  If neither input has a number in its airity, then the function will return null.  The tests check for numbers, and for nothing or a letter/word being inputed.  Both of which will return back "null".
